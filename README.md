# PyLightcurve 

A python package for analysing exoplanet light-curves.

<img src="https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/pylightcurve/blob/master/logo.png" width="25%">

In PyLightcurve you will find tools for:

* Exoplanet transit and eclipse modeling.
* Flexible fitting of multi-epoch and multi-colour exoplanet transit and eclipse
      light-curves.

# History

## PyLightcurve v4.1.x

### Changes in usage compared to Pylightcurve v4.0.x versions:

- Parameters renamed

An attempt has been made to use more consistent and self-explainable parameter names in PyLightcurve. 
Please pay extra care when accessing the fitting output, almost all parameter names have changed!

- New structure for fitting output

Please check the notebook ```notebooks/2_detrending_examples/0_a_simple_lc_fitting.ipynb``` to see the structure of the fitting output.

- New way of accessing the LDCs and the Fp/Fs in the planet class

```python
# v4.0
limb_darkening_coefficients = planet.filter('COUSINS_R').limb_darkening_coefficients
fp_over_fs = planet.filter('COUSINS_R').fp_over_fs
rp_over_rs = planet.filter('COUSINS_R').rp_over_rs

# v4.1
limb_darkening_coefficients = planet.exotethys('COUSINS_R', ldc_method='claret',
                                               wlrange=None, stellar_model='Phoenix_2018')
# available methods: claret, power2, quad, linear
# available stellar models: Atlas_2000, Phoenix_2012_13, Stagger_2015, Stagger_2018
#                           Phoenix_2018, Phoenix_drift_2012
fp_over_fs = planet.fp_over_fs('COUSINS_R', wlrange=None)
rp_over_rs = planet.rp_over_rs
```


- Planet eclipse time is not automatically calulated
```python
# v4.0
eclipse_mid_time = planet.eclipse_mid_time

# v4.1
eclipse_mid_time = planet.eclipse_mid_time()
```


- New way of adding custom filters or limb darkening coefficients in the planet class
```python
# v4.0
planet.add_filter('my_filter', rp_over_rs, ldc1, ldc2, ldc3, ldc4, fp_over_fs)
# The passband file should be a txt file containing two columns separated by space or tab:
# column 1: wavelength in A
# column 2: total throughput in electrons/photons

# v4.1 - add a filter to the PyLightcurve database and use it as the default filters
plc.add_filter('my_filter', 'path_to_passband.txt')
# v4.1 - add custom limb darkening coefficients to planet 
planet.add_custom_limb_darkening_coefficients([ldc1, ldc2, ldc3, ldc4], filter_name, wlrange=None, stellar_model='my_model')
```

- Stellar model is no longer defined when initialising a Planet object (no ```ldc_stellar_model``` argument), it is defined when adding an observation
  

- New definition of iterations in MCMC
```python
# v4.0 -  total model evaluations = iterations
iterations, walkers = 15000, 3

# v4.1 - total model evaluations = iterations x walkers
iterations, walkers = 5000, 3
```


- Time conversions are now available through the Planet class directly
```python
# v4.0
time_in_bjd_tdb = planet.target.convert_to_bjd_tdb(time_in_hjd_utc, 'HJD_UTC')


# v4.1 
time_in_bjd_tdb = planet.convert_to_bjd_tdb(time_in_hjd_utc, 'HJD_UTC')
# or
time_in_bjd_tdb = plc.convert_to_bjd_tdb(ra_in_degrees, dec_in_degrees, time_in_hjd_utc, 'HJD_UTC')
# where ra, dec in degrees
# available formats: JD_UTC, MJD_UTC, HJD_UTC, HJD_TDB, BJD_UTC, BJD_TDB
```


- When performing core calculations directly or through a ```plc.Planet``` object, 
  all time arrays must be provided in ```BJD_TDB```, so you need to convert them first
```python
# v4.0
time_in_jd_utc = np.arange(planet.mid_time - 0.1, planet.mid_time + 0.1, 0.001)
transit_model = planet.transit(time_in_jd_utc, time_format='JD_UTC', filter_name='COUSINS_R')


# v4.1 
time_in_jd_utc = np.arange(planet.mid_time - 0.1, planet.mid_time + 0.1, 0.001)
time_in_bjd_tdb = planet.convert_to_bjd_tdb(time_in_hjd_utc, 'JD_UTC')
transit_model = planet.transit(time_array_in_jd_utc, filter_name='COUSINS_R')
```

- PyLightcurve now accepts angles as floats only (degrees). No angle transformations through 
  ```pylightcurve``` are available, please use the new ```exoclock``` package.
```python
# v4.0
ra = plc.Hours('22:03:10.7729')

ra_in_degrees = ra.deg()
ra_in_hours = ra.hours()
ra_in_rad = ra.rad()
ra_in_dms = ra.dms()
ra_in_dms_coordinate = ra.dms_coord() # this will give the angle between -90 and 90 degrees
ra_in_hms = ra.hms()
ra_in_degrees_coordinate = ra.deg_coord() # this will give the angle between -90 and 90 degrees

# v4.1 
import exoclock
ra = exoclock.Hours('22:03:10.7729')

ra_in_degrees = ra.deg()
ra_in_hours = ra.hours()
ra_in_rad = ra.rad()
ra_in_dms = ra.dms()
ra_in_dms_coordinate = ra.dms_coord() # this will give the angle between -90 and 90 degrees
ra_in_hms = ra.hms()
ra_in_degrees_coordinate = ra.deg_coord() # this will give the angle between -90 and 90 degrees
```

### New features:
- Custom detrending
- Automatic scaling of uncertainties, outliers rejection and initial parameter optimisation
- Wrapper for ExoTETHyS and LDCs for sub-bandpass
- More precise integration
- Airmass detrending
- Flux/Mag conversions available through the Planet class

### PyLightcurve v4.1.x - [latest (v4.0.4)](https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/pylightcurve/releases/tag/v4.0.4)

- PyLightcurve 4.0 no longer supports the use of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue (OEC), due to the large number
of mistakes in the catalogue and the absence of parameters updates. OEC has been replaced by the
Exoplanet Characterisation Catalogue, dedicated to transiting exoplanets. This catalogue does not contain all the
exoplanets at the moment but will be continuously updated with more planets.

- Version 4.0 brings a new easy way of simultaneously fitting light curves from different
sources (different flux and time formats, different exposure times), different filters
(multi-colour) and different epochs (multi-epoch).
  
- We now have the option of modeling eclipse data (finally!) and also tools to calculate the
eclipse mid-time, eclipse depth and eclipse duration, based of the orbital characteristics
of the planet.
  
- In this version, the default limb-darkening coefficients are calculated using the new
package [ExoTETHyS](https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/ExoTETHyS). This allows the
calculation of the limb-darkening coefficients even for stars cooler than 3500 K.

- PyLighrcurve 4.0 includes flexible objects for converting different expressions of
angles (e.g. '+47:12:34.05' to degrees) and of timing systems (e.g. HJD_UTC to BJD_TDB).

### 4.0.1
- Fixed packaging and test issues.

### 4.0.2 
- Database updates checked in memory.
- Fixed database updating loop.

### 4.0.3
- Fix np.float bug.

### 4.0.4
- Fixed packaging and test issues.
- Fixed latex strings in plots.
- Fixed matplotlib.cm.get_cmap bug.
